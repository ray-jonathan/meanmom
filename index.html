  <h1>Hello and welcome to the Mean Mom API!</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>
    Your assignment is to make your favorite #MeanMom a simple webpage using HTML, CSS, and <em>especially</em> Javascript.
    <br>
    You should fill the page with 4 boxes. Each box should have an image as the background, and some text floating above it. What those images and text should be are outlined below.
    <br>
    <strong>No,</strong> you don't have to create a Pull Request for this but you should seriously consider trying this assignment and making a PR so that you can get feedback, learn new tricks, and bask in the warm appreciated glow of #MeanMom. Yes, there are some random/occasional failures built into the API to simulate what it's like, dealing with them in the real world! Promise you though, it's all doable and STELLAR practice for your group projects.
    <br>
    #MeanMom loves her babies ♥, well some of them anyway, GOOD LUCK!
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 80%">PS- when I say <strong>:something</strong>, I mean that any (single word) string can be put in its place, no ":" included. That just means you can put your own word there!</p>
  </p>

  <p>Your #MeanMom is thirsty, this API has an endpoint for that!</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Here's how:
    <br>
    Use the <strong>/dranks/:alcohol_type</strong> path to return a #MeanMom approved drink.
    The <strong>:alcohol</strong> parameter could be something like "Gin," "Vodka," etc. Don't put anything #MeanMom doesn't like or recognize or she'll yell at you!
    <br>
    Use the image supplied from the API as background for the cocktail name.
    <br>
    Also, sometimes she likes to just yell. It be like that sometimes, get used to it.

  <p>#MeanMom always needs to know where the closest Marta bus is so she can make a quick get away. Help her out by displaying the closest bus to you, before she writes you out the will.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Here's how:
    <br>
    Use the <strong>/buses</strong> to get all the Marta buses nearby. You're going to need to look up the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation">Geolocation</a> object to get access to your coordinates.
    Additionally, you'll wanna borrow this handy function. You shouldn't have to modify the function at all. 
    <pre><code>
    function distanceBetweenTwoCoords(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {
      function toRad(n) {
        return n * Math.PI / 180;
        };
        function toDeg(n) {
        return n * 180 / Math.PI;
        };
      var a = 6378137;
      var b = 6356752.3142;
      var f = 1 / 298.257223563; // WGS-84 ellipsoid params
      var L = toRad((lon2-lon1));
      var x = Math.atan((1 - f));
      var U1 = x * Math.tan(toRad(lat1));
      var U2 = x * Math.tan(toRad(lat2));
      var sinU1 = Math.sin(U1);
      var cosU1 = Math.cos(U1);
      var sinU2 = Math.sin(U2);
      var cosU2 = Math.cos(U2);
      var lambda = L;
      var lambdaP;
      var iterLimit = 100;
      do {
        var sinLambda = Math.sin(lambda),
            cosLambda = Math.cos(lambda),
            sinSigma = Math.sqrt((cosU2 * sinLambda) * (cosU2 * sinLambda) + (cosU1 * sinU2 - sinU1 * cosU2 * cosLambda) * (cosU1 * sinU2 - sinU1 * cosU2 * cosLambda));
        if (0 === sinSigma) {
        return 0; // co-incident points
        };
        var cosSigma = sinU1 * sinU2 + cosU1 * cosU2 * cosLambda,
            sigma = Math.atan2(sinSigma, cosSigma),
            sinAlpha = cosU1 * cosU2 * sinLambda / sinSigma,
            cosSqAlpha = 1 - sinAlpha * sinAlpha,
            cos2SigmaM = cosSigma - 2 * sinU1 * sinU2 / cosSqAlpha,
            C = f / 16 * cosSqAlpha * (4 + f * (4 - 3 * cosSqAlpha));
        if (isNaN(cos2SigmaM)) {
        cos2SigmaM = 0; // equatorial line: cosSqAlpha = 0 (§6)
        };
        lambdaP = lambda;
        lambda = L + (1 - C) * f * sinAlpha * (sigma + C * sinSigma * (cos2SigmaM + C * cosSigma * (-1 + 2 * cos2SigmaM * cos2SigmaM)));
      } while (Math.abs(lambda - lambdaP) > 1e-12 && --iterLimit > 0);
      
      if (0 === iterLimit) {
        return NaN; // formula failed to converge
      };
      
      var uSq = cosSqAlpha * (a * a - b * b) / (b * b),
          A = 1 + uSq / 16384 * (4096 + uSq * (-768 + uSq * (320 - 175 * uSq))),
          B = uSq / 1024 * (256 + uSq * (-128 + uSq * (74 - 47 * uSq))),
          deltaSigma = B * sinSigma * (cos2SigmaM + B / 4 * (cosSigma * (-1 + 2 * cos2SigmaM * cos2SigmaM) - B / 6 * cos2SigmaM * (-3 + 4 * sinSigma * sinSigma) * (-3 + 4 * cos2SigmaM * cos2SigmaM))),
          s = b * A * (sigma - deltaSigma);
      return s.toFixed(1); // round to .1m precision
    };
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    Tell her where she can meet it. (The <code>"TIMEPOINT"</code> key from the API.)
    <br>
    Use this image <code>src</code> for your background: <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none">https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bus-2.png?w=664&h=441&crop=1</a>
    <br>
    Also, sometimes she interferes with the Marta API. It be like that sometimes, get used to it.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>Your #MeanMom is looking for inspiration, be a good kid and help her make a tacky poster!</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Here's how:
    <br>
    Use the <strong>/inspiration</strong> path to return a #MeanMom expression.
    Adding <code>?category=<strong>:option</strong></code> will return a quote of that kind. Don't put anything #MeanMom doesn't like or recognize or she'll yell at you!
    <br>
    <text style="padding-left: 20px">Options:</text> <code style="padding-left: 40px" >computers, cookie, definitions, miscellaneous, people, platitudes, politics, science,</code> and <code>wisdom</code>
    <br>
    For the poster image's <code>src</code>, use this: <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none">https://picsum.photos/400</a>. It'll produce a random image for you to use as your poster background.
    <br>
    Also, sometimes she disapproves. It be like that sometimes, get used to it.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>#MeanMom needs some guidance: she doesn't know where she went <em>so wrong</em> with raising you.</p>
  <p>Read her horoscope to her so she can make sense of the cosmic plan for her imminent success.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Here's how:
    <br>
    Use the <strong>/horoscope/:sunsign</strong> path to return #MeanMom's horoscope. Create a dropdown menu for her to select her 'sun-sign.'
    The <strong>:sunsign</strong> parameter should be something like "virgo," "scorpio," etc. Don't put anything #MeanMom doesn't recognize or she'll yell at you!
    <br>
    For the background image <code>src</code>, use this: <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none">https://picsum.photos/400</a>. It'll produce a random image for you to use as your poster background.
    <br>
    Also, sometimes she doesn't like what the universe is trying to say. It be like that sometimes, get used to it.
