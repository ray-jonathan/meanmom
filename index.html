  <h1>Hello and welcome to the Mean Mom API!</h1>
  <br>
  <p>If your #MeanMom is thirsty, this API has an endpoint for that!</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Here's how:
    <br>
    Use the <strong>/dranks/:alcohol_type</strong> path to return a #MeanMom approved drink.
    The <strong>:alcohol</strong> parameter could be something like "Gin," "Vodka," etc. Don't put anything #MeanMom doesn't like or recognize or she'll yell at you!
    <br>
    Also, sometimes she likes to just yell. It be like that sometimes, get used to it.
  </p>
